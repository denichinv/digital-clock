## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/denichinv/digital-clock.git
   cd digital-clock
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn

   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal)

## Customization

### Changing the Background

Replace the `wallpaper.jpg` and `night.jpg` files in the `assets` folder with your preferred images. The image paths are referenced in `App.jsx`, and the appropriate one is automatically chosen based on the current time.

### Time Format

To switch between 12-hour and 24-hour formats, modify the `hour12` property in `App.jsx`:

```jsx
// For 12-hour format
time.toLocaleTimeString("en-GB", { hour12: true })

// For 24-hour format (current setting)
time.toLocaleTimeString("en-GB", { hour12: false })
```

### Date Format

The date format can be customized by changing the options in the `toLocaleDateString` method:

```jsx
time.toLocaleDateString("en-GB", { 
  weekday: "long",  // "long", "short", or "narrow"
  day: "2-digit",   // "numeric" or "2-digit"
  month: "long",    // "numeric", "2-digit", "long", "short", or "narrow"
  year: "numeric"   // "numeric" or "2-digit"
})
```

### Adjusting Gradient Transparency

To modify the text gradient transparency, check the `App.jsx` file where `rgba()` values are used to control color stops and opacity.

```jsx
bg-gradient-to-r from-[rgba(110,231,183,0.35)] via-[rgba(52,211,153,0.35)] to-[rgba(20,184,166,0.35)]
```

You can increase or decrease the `0.35` value to make the text more or less transparent.
